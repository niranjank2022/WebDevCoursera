            <div class="content">Chicken is rich in important nutrients and can be an excellent addition to a healthy, well-rounded diet.
                                Given that chicken is low in calories but high in protein, it may be especially beneficial for weight loss.
                                Studies show that increasing your intake of protein may enhance feelings of fullness, increase weight loss, and help maintain lean body mass.</div>

            <div class="header" id="sushi">Sushi</div>
            <div class="content">Sushi is a seaweed roll filled with cooked rice, raw or cooked fish, and vegetables. Sushi first became popular as a way to preserve fish.
                                The cleaned fish was pressed between rice and salt and allowed to ferment for a few weeks until it was ready to eat.
                                Vinegar was added to the rice to reduce the fermentation time and improve its taste. Sushi is regarded as a health food because it boasts several nutrient-rich ingredients.</div>
